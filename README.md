# Hughes Lab Tools for VMT Device Image Processing

## Overview

The Hughes Lab Tools are designed for processing images captured from VMT (Vascular and Tumor) devices using ImageJ/Fiji. This project leverages ImageJ’s powerful image processing capabilities and integrates custom tools for medical image analysis, providing a tailored interface for operations such as thresholding, segmentation, and measurement.

## Project Structure and Key Classes

### **Device Class**
The `Device` class serves as the base class for managing general device-related operations. This class provides a foundation that other specialized classes can extend for more specific functionality.

### **DeviceManager Class**
The `DeviceManager` class orchestrates the image processing workflow. It handles user input from the GUI, manages options, and executes the appropriate operations on the images. This class acts as the central controller, coordinating between the GUI, `DeviceImage` objects, and user preferences.

### **DeviceImage Class**
The `DeviceImage` class is a subclass of ImageJ's `ImagePlus` class. By extending `ImagePlus`, it inherits all of ImageJ’s core image handling capabilities while adding device-specific processing features, such as saving and loading medical images.

### **TumorImage Class**
The `TumorImage` class extends `DeviceImage` and provides specialized methods for tumor image analysis, such as segmentation, measuring grey levels, and calculating circularity.

### **VesselImage Class**
The `VesselImage` class extends `DeviceImage` and focuses on vascular image analysis, offering methods for thresholding images, converting them to masks, and measuring vessel diameters.

### **VmoToolsGui Class**
The `VmoToolsGui` class is responsible for creating and displaying the graphical user interface (GUI) that collects user input. It allows users to select various options for image processing, such as the number of image types, color settings, and processing functions (e.g., segmentation or thresholding). These options are then stored in an `options` dictionary.

Users can interact with this GUI to configure their processing tasks. However, the `VmoToolsGui` class also allows for programmatic configuration. Instead of manually inputting all options through the GUI, you can set options directly in code and pass them to the `DeviceManager`, allowing for automation and scripting.

### **ImageTypeChangerGui Class**
The `ImageTypeChangerGui` class handles interactions related to changing the type of image being processed. This includes confirming the image type and switching between image types as needed.

## Option Setting Methods

### Programmatic Option Setting

While the GUI is the primary method for configuring options, options can also be set programmatically and passed directly to the `DeviceManager` for execution. This is useful for automating processes or integrating the tool into larger workflows.

Here’s an example of how you can bypass the GUI and set options programmatically in a script:

```python
import os
from HughesLabTools.DeviceManager import DeviceManager
from HughesLabTools import gui

# Create a DeviceManager instance
device_manager = DeviceManager(verbose=True)

# Set options programmatically
options = {
    'numTypes': 2,
    'typeNames': ['Tumor', 'Vessel'],
    'typeColors': ['Red', 'Green'],
    'segment': True,
    'threshold': False
}

# Configure DeviceManager with these options
device_manager.configure(options)

# Now you can proceed with further processing
device_manager.run_selected_processes()
```

In this example, the options dictionary is populated directly in the code and passed to the `DeviceManager`. This bypasses the need to manually configure the options through the GUI, enabling automation and scripting.

### GUI Option Setting

Alternatively, you can use the GUI to set the options interactively and then pass them to the `DeviceManager` for processing. Here’s an example of how to do this:

```python
import os
from HughesLabTools.DeviceManager import DeviceManager
from HughesLabTools import gui

# Create a DeviceManager instance
device_manager = DeviceManager(verbose=True)

# Run the GUI and configure options
device_manager.configure_with_gui()

# Now you can proceed with further processing if processes are selected
device_manager.run_selected_processes()
```

In this example, the `VmoToolsGui` class is used to display the GUI, collect options from the user, and configure the `DeviceManager`. Once the options are set, the images can be processed as per the user’s selections.

### How It Works

1. **Collecting Options via GUI**:
   - The `VmoToolsGui` class displays the GUI and collects options such as the number of image types, their names, and their colors. Users can select the image processing functions to perform (e.g., segmentation or thresholding).

2. **Programmatic Configuration**:
   - Instead of manually selecting options through the GUI, options can be set directly in the script. The `DeviceManager` class can then be configured with these options, allowing for automated workflows.

3. **Running Processes**:
   - Once options are configured (either via the GUI or programmatically), the `DeviceManager` can execute the selected processes using the `run_selected_processes()` method.

## Extending the Project

### **Adding New Image Types**
1. **Create a New Image Class**:
   - Define a new class that extends `DeviceImage`. Implement specific methods for processing the new image type.
   - Example:
   ```python
   from DeviceImage import DeviceImage

   class NewImageType(DeviceImage):
       def process_specific_feature(self):
           # Implement processing logic here
           pass
   ```

2. **Integrate with GUI**:
   - Update `VmoToolsGui` to include options for the new image type, allowing users to select it from the interface.

3. **Update DeviceManager**:
   - Extend `DeviceManager` to handle the new image type and its associated operations.

### **Adding New Image Processing Functions**
1. **Define New Functions**:
   - Add new methods in the relevant image class (e.g., `TumorImage` or `VesselImage`).
   - Ensure the new methods are integrated into the image processing workflow.

2. **Update GUI**:
   - Modify `VmoToolsGui` to include new options for these additional functions.

3. **Testing**:
   - Test the new functionality across various images to ensure correctness.

## Leveraging ImageJ/Fiji

This project integrates tightly with ImageJ/Fiji, utilizing the `ImagePlus` class and all its associated capabilities. Since the `DeviceImage` class subclasses `ImagePlus`, you can apply any ImageJ functionality directly within the project. This allows for extending the toolset by incorporating ImageJ plugins and further customizing the image processing pipeline.
